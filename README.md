# App Churn Prediction and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting user churn for a mobile app. It involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data, building a predictive model to identify users who are likely to churn, and creating a graphical user interface (GUI) using Streamlit to visualize the results and predictions.
