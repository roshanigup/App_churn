    ## Dataset Description
    This dataset contains various user metrics that are used for predicting customer churn. The main features include:
    - **Average Screen Time**: Average daily time the user spends on the app.
    - **Average Spent on App (INR)**: Average amount of money spent by the user on the app.
    - **Left Review**: Indicates whether the user has left a review (1) or not (0).
    - **Ratings**: The user's rating for the app.
    - **New Password Request**: Indicates if the user has requested a new password (1) or not (0).
    - **Last Visited Minutes**: Minutes since the user last visited the app.
    - **Status**: Current status of the user, which could include active, inactive, etc.
    - **Segments**: User segmentation based on behavior and engagement patterns.
